feature/Bitwise_Operations
* Electricity can be one of two states - off or on. computers use these states to represent unique data values where off represents a zero and on is a one.
* You can imagine computer memory to be comprised of many boxes where each box holds a single light bulb
* This smallest size box in memory is called a bit because it can hold a value of zero or one. It is capable of storing only two unique values.
* Two bits are capable of storing four values where each value is determined by a different sequence of zeros and ones.
* When eight bits are used, a bigger number of 01 sequences is possible. In fact, eight bits are capable of storing 256 unique sequences in computing. Eight bits is called a bite.
* The sequences of zeros and ones used in computing is called binary.
* We consider each box in the sequence to represent a value equal to two to the power of something and working from 
  right to left allocate each box with increasing power starting at zero - 2^7......2^0. We can convert each power into a decimal value.
* To convert the sequence to dennery which is a number in our regular counting system, we add together the values of each box with a one state
* The largest number you can store in a bite is when all the boxes are filled with ones. This adds up to 255 together with zero. It makes up the 256 values that a bite can hold.
* Bitwise operations -> manipulate individual bits within a single variable for bitwise operations.
